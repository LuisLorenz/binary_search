# idea
- create a list of 1000 animal names in English 
- search one excat animal with normal search and record time 
- principle
    - sorting the list by alphabet 
    - comparing the first letter with the searched word
        - e.g.: word is more in the beginning of the alphabet 
        - continue
        - when the first letter is the same (confirmed) get started with the next word 
        - check if I can narrow down all word to one with all the confirmation each round
        - so how many words start with A as first letter, and with M as second letter and E as thrid letter

- keep it simple and go to the next project instead
